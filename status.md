# Status

_Vision: `vision.md`. How we work: `AGENTS.md` → "How we build now". The
book: `architecture/`. Machine gates (they TRAIL): `python3 conformance/run.py`._

## RESUME BLOCK (keep current at every stopping point)

- **Where we are:** the **third draft**, just begun (2026-07-07). `src/` is
  an empty frame (`src/syg/main.cpp` dispatches nothing yet). The book,
  conformance suite, and `adr.md` are carried verbatim at root from probe2 —
  the SPEC is unchanged; only the implementation was thrown away. Both prior
  implementations are deprecated probes: `probe/probe1` (the working C++/VR
  monolith, pre-ontology) and `probe/probe2` (the greenfield that reached
  163-green + rung-12 self-hosting in a day, unwatched — reference and
  salvage; much of the third draft may be it ported forward WITH explanation).

- **Why we restarted (the pivot, 2026-07-07):** probe2 went green without
  anyone able to say in their heart it was the thing we described — still
  10k+ lines of C++, some natives that had no right being C++, built with
  ~zero human oversight. This draft is paced by **Travis reading and signing
  every line.** The real project is changing Travis's brain, not shipping;
  patience is the discipline, speed is not an acceptance criterion. Full
  norms in `AGENTS.md` — read them before writing code.

- **Next action:** with Travis, start at the **escapement** — the smallest
  unit complete enough to hold fully in his head — and bring it to him to
  READ (likely probe2's escapement ported forward, explained line by line).
  Do NOT race `conformance/run.py`; it trails as evidence. First real
  milestone is sense-first: escapement → crown → smallest playable graph
  driving one sense, the whole edit-and-it-changes-live loop alive.

- **Active disciplines:** **50-line C++ cap** (never present more than 50
  lines of C++ at once — cross it and stop to explain; build/nix/cmake/shell/
  android exempt); read-and-sign (Travis's comprehension is the clock); gate on taste, not the suite; explaining IS the nativeness gate
  (a native that can't be justified out loud dies); sense-first build order;
  watch for hollow EXPLANATIONS (he predicts the next line / catches the code).

- **Open with Travis:** how to reform the conformance suite for this
  direction — invert it so human-blessed sense checkpoints lead and machine
  gates trail (his suggestion invited, not yet designed).
